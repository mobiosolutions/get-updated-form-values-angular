## GET UPDATED FORM VALUES 

This project demostrates getting updated values from Angular Reactive forms. 

It can be useful to log only updated values which a user updates rather than logging all the values updated.

It also supports nested form groups. 

In this demo we have consider update scenario but it can be used at the time of creating a record.
